> ### ReScript + React codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://jsoo-react-realworld-example-app.vercel.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[ReScript & React](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **ReScript & React** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

Basically its just like React single-page-application but written in [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

- Using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the frontend build tool
- Seamlessly integrate with [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) (previously known as BuckleScript/ReasonML) and [rescript-react](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction)
- Routing - ReScript React [Router](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/router)

# Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://jsoo-react-realworld-example-app.vercel.app

To get the frontend running locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jihchi/jsoo-react-realworld-example-app.git
cd jsoo-react-realworld-example-app
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to see your app.

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a production build with `npm run build` and you will find result in folder `/dist`, after you created a production build, you can execute `npm run serve` to serve the folder.
